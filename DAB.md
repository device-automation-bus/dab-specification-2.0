# 1. Introduction
This document describes Device Automation Bus (DAB), a simple protocol for intuitively interacting with living room devices. Living room devices are consumer electronics in the living room that are connected to the Internet such as televisions and games consoles. DAB is a protocol that allows device manufacturers and application developers to programmatically communicate with living room devices to start and stop applications, send key presses to the device, restart the device, capture device metrics among other operations. Using DAB, device manufacturers and application developers can automate manual tasks such as application compatibility checks, cross application performance testing and monitoring device memory usage. Automating manual tasks provides reliable results and saves time and money.

The diagram below provides a high level view of how DAB works:

# 2. About the Specification
This specification describes a message based protocol to support programmatically communicating with a device under test. This specification provides a description of the supported messages and their payloads as well as positive and negative response codes.

The DAB protocol is built on top of [MQTT 5](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html). MQTT is a publish-subscribe messaging transport protocol for connecting to remote devices. For more details, see https://mqtt.org/

### Not covered in the specification
The following topics are not covered in this specification:
#### Security
Recommendations for securing DAB, as well as connecting to a device under test that supports DAB will be defined in a separate document.
#### Protocol Compliance
Protocol Compliance testing will be defined in a separate DAB certification guide.

# 3. Requirements

An endpoint is DAB compliant only if the following conditions are met:
- [HTTP/1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230) or above is supported for media operations
- 2 megabytes are dedicated to DAB for media operations

# 4. Protocol Basics
This section describes message payloads, request and response formats, message types and common status codes.

## Request / Response Model
DAB relies on the [MQTT request/response](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901252) model which is native to all MQTT 5 compliant brokers and clients.

To send requests and receive responses from DAB:
1. The responding client (device side) is running and subscribed to all topics corresponding to the supported DAB operations.
2. The requesting client (user side) determines to which topic responses should be sent and subscribes to this `responseTopic`. Response topics may be reused if `correlationData` is included, otherwise they must be unique.
3. The requesting client generates a unique binary request ID, referred to as `correlationData`, to aid in associating responses with requests. Use of correlation data is not required, but strongly encouraged.
4. The requesting client publishes the message to the request topic with the required `responseTopic` and optional `correlationData` message properties.
5. When the request is received by the responding client, an operation is performed, response message is formed, `correlationData` is copied from the request message property to the response (if it exists), and the message is published to the `responseTopic` property from the request.
6. The operation is complete when the requesting client receives a message on the `responseTopic` with matching `correlationData` (if applicable), or the client chooses to time out the request.

##### Example
1. The user client wants to send a message to the request topic `dab/<device-id>/health-check/get` and get responses at `dab/userClient-1/responses`. Note: The `responseTopic` doesn't have to be similar to `dab/userClient-1/responses`, it can be anything that the user client specifies. Device client uses the `responseTopic` field to send back the response.
2. A unique binary `correlationData` value is generated.
3. The user client subscribes to `dab/userClient-1/responses` and waits for a response message with the matching `correlationData` value to arrive.
4. The user client publishes a message to `dab/<device-id>/health-check/get` with request properties `correlationData` and `responseTopic: dab/userClient-1/responses`.
5. When a message sent by device client is received on the user client at `dab/userClient-1/responses` with matching `correlationData`, the message payload will be the health-check response and the operation is complete.

##### Sample MQTT Request Message:
```json
{
   "topic": "dab/<device-id>/health-check/get",
   "correlationData": "abc",
   "responseTopic": "dab/userClient-1/responses",
   "payload": "DabRequest{...}"
}
```

##### Sample MQTT Response Message:
```json
{
   "topic": "dab/userClient-1/responses",
   "correlationData": "abc",
   "payload": "DabResponse{...}"
}
```

### Device ID Implementation Guidelines
The Device ID is an unique identifier that helps with DAB message routing across multiple device clients.

One should implement the Device ID as:
1. The device under test defines what its Device ID should be.
	2.1. It may or may not be baked into the device, but it should be globally unique.
	2.2. It may be configurable, but using transient values, such as current IP address, is not recommended as this can make reconnecting after restart difficult.
2. Device ID must be a string, and only include lower case alphanumeric characters and -_.

### Device Setup
When a device client first connected to the MQTT broker, it should do the following setup procedure:
1. Subscribe to all topics listed in this spec, like `dab/<device-id>/device/info` topic. 
2. Subscribe to `dab/discovery` topic.

### Device Discovery
These are the steps using which a user client can discover all the DAB device clients present in the current setup:

1. When a User client connects to the MQTT broker for the first time, there might be device clients already connected to the broker. User Client should publish a request to the discovery topic `dab/discovery` similar to the following:
```json
{
   "topic": "dab/discovery",
   "correlationData": "abc",
   "responseTopic": "dab/userClient-1/responses",
   "payload": "DabRequest{...}"
}
```
2. All connected DAB devices will send a response back to the `responseTopic` as set by the user client. The user client can then extract the device-id from these responses.

### Message Payloads
DAB protocol message payloads are always JSON and the characters must use UTF-8 encoding.

This specification uses [typescript interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) to define request and response schemas. Typescript interfaces are used in order to be descriptive, compact and concise with the request and response schema definitions.

As an example, the following JSON maps to the example Typescript interface (and vice versa):

```json
{
   "variableName": "Value",
}
```
maps to:

```typescript
interface ExampleResponse {
   variableName: string;
   optionallyIncludedVariable?: string;
}
```

For more information on TypeScript, please see the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs).

### Common DAB Request Payload

All DAB requests must be valid JSON objects even if no parameters are required. All DAB requests must inherit from the  `DabRequest` format

#### Request Format

```typescript
interface DabRequest {
}
```
Sample Response
An empty request is equal to an empty JSON map

```json
{}
```

### Common DAB Response Payload

All DAB responses must inherit from the  `DabResponse` format. DAB responses must contain the `status` field and may contain the `error` field when an error occurs.

#### Response Format

```typescript
interface DabResponse {
   status: number;
   error?: string;
}
```

#### Response Parameters

Parameter |  Description
--- | ---
status | status code
error | optional explanation of the error

#### Common status codes

Status code | Description
--- | ---
200 | The request was successful.
400 | Bad request. The request was invalid or malformed. The explanation of the error must be included in the `error` field of the response.
500 | Internal error. The explanation of the error must be included in the `error` field of the response.
501 | Not implemented. The device must return this error when the requested functionality is not implemented.

An operation must respond with one of the above common status codes, unless the operation states otherwise.

#### Sample Responses

A response with the success status code

```json
{
   "status": 200
}
```

A response with the error status code

```json
{
   "status": 400,
   "error": "App parameter is required to launch the application"
}
```

## Unsolicited Messages
Unsolicited Messages are a feature of MQTT. An unsolicited message is a message that can be sent to communicate temporal messages like memory usage. In most cases, the client will subscribe to a topic where these messages are being sent. The client may or may not have to send a request for these messages to be enabled. Subscribing to the topic does not give the client a history or even the last published message - they will only get future messages.

## Data Types Definitions

|Friendly name|Type identifier|Description|Example|
|-|-|-|-|
|Language code|`rfc_5646_language_tag`|All language tags use the IETF language tags defined in [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646). All language tags are string fields.|"en-US"|
|UNIX Time stamp|`unix_timestamp_ms`|UNIX Epoch time in milliseconds. The data type is a 64 bit unsigned integer.|1568815387403|
|Application Identifier|`appId`|The application identifier consists of characters. For resiliency, uppercase letters are equivalent to lowercase (e.g., "netflix" is the same as "Netflix"). The minimum number of characters is 1 and the maximum is 64.|"PrimeVideo"|
|Uniform Resource Locator|`url`|MQTT has a max play load size of 256mb for binary data. HTTP is used for pushing and pulling resources from devices to support larger media files. URLs are defined in [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).|http://192.168.0.1/file|

### Standardized Application and Voice System Identifiers in Appendix

In order to refer to applications and voice systems in a standardized manner, key application identifiers and voice system names are provided within [Secton 7 -- Appendix](#7-appendix). DAB implementations must use these appId and voice system names, and not any internal codenames. This is necessary for test automation to use uniform names across all DAB-capable platforms.

# 5. DAB Operations

## 5.1 Supported operations

      "voice/send-text",
   ]
}
```

## 5.2. Applications

### Application states

An application can be in one of the following states:

State | Description
--- | ---
STOPPED | There is no instance of the application running on the device.
FOREGROUND | The application is visible, active and accepting input.
BACKGROUND | There is a running instance of the application on the device but it is not visible and not accepting input.

Your device may support more states, choose the one that best represents the described state

### Operation: Listing all the Applications
*Operation model: Request / Response*

This operation lists the applications installed on the device. This list can be limited to applications that are known to leverage DAB.

#### Request Topic

`dab/<device-id>/applications/list`

#### Request Format

```typescript
type ListApplicationsRequest = DabRequest
```

#### Response Format

```typescript
interface Application {
   appId: string;
   friendlyName?: string;
   version?: string;
}
```

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
appId | Application Identifier, as [defined in the DAB Registry](#7-appendix)
friendlyName | *optional* application friendly name
version | *optional* application version

```typescript
interface ListApplicationsResponse extends DabResponse {
   applications: Application [];
}
```

#### Response Parameters

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
applications | a list of applications

#### Sample Response
```json
{
   "status": 200,
   "applications": [
      {
         "appId": "Netflix",
         "friendlyName": "Netflix",
         "version": "2.0.0"
      },
      {
         "appId": "PrimeVideo",
         "friendlyName": "Amazon Prime Video",
         "version": "2.0.0"
      },
      {
         "appId": "YouTube",
         "friendlyName": "YouTube",
         "version": "2.0.0"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Operation: Launching an Application
*Operation model: Request / Response*

This operation launches an instance of the application into the FOREGROUND state. There can only be one instance of an application running in the system and the instance is referenced by the application identifier. The response should only be sent after the application state has changed on the platform.

* If the application is in the STOPPED state, this operation will launch a new instance into the FOREGROUND state. 
* If the application is in the BACKGROUND state, this operation will bring the instance of the application into the FOREGROUND state. 
* If the application is in the FOREGROUND state, this operation will not change the state of the application.


#### Request Topic

`dab/<device-id>/applications/launch`

#### Request Format

```typescript
interface LaunchApplicationRequest extends DabRequest {
   appId: string;
   parameters?: string [];
}
```

#### Request Parameters

Parameter | Default |  Description
--- | --- | ---
appId | - | Application Identifier
parameters | `[]` | URL encoded list of parameters to be passed to the application being launched (usually directly to the app executable). The technique to pass parameters may be app specific. Please work with [app partners in DAB Registry](#7-appendix) for how the parameters are expected to be passed.

#### Sample Request

```json
{
   "appId": "Netflix",
   "parameters": [
    "-KEY",
    "https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example-value.com%2F",
    "-STANDALONE_PARAM",
    "%22param-with-quotes%22",
   ]
}
```

In the above sample, since `parameters` is defined, DAB implementations must URL decode each parameter and pass them in order. As an example, for Netflix it would look like `./netflix -KEY https://www.example-value.com -STANDALONE_PARAM "param-with-quotes"`. Note how the order is preserved and parameters containing quotes and other miscellaneous characters are passed without issue due to URL encoding / decoding.

#### Response Format

```typescript
type LaunchApplicationResponse = DabResponse
```

### Operation: Launching an application to the specified content
*Operation model: Request / Response*

This operation launches the application into FOREGROUND state with the specified content (also known as deep linking). There can only be one instance of an application running in the system and the instance is referenced by the application identifier. The response should only be sent after the application state has changed on the platform.

* If the application is in the STOPPED state, this operation will launch a new instance into the FOREGROUND state with the specified content
* If the application is in the BACKGROUND state, this operation will bring the instance of the application into the FOREGROUND and pass the specified content to the instance
* If the application is in the FOREGROUND state, this operation will pass the content to the instance


#### Request Topic

`dab/<device-id>/applications/launch-with-content`

#### Request format

```typescript
interface LaunchApplicationWithContentRequest extends DabRequest {
   appId: string;
   contentId: string;
   parameters?: string [];
}
```

#### Request Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
appId | - | Application Identifier
contentId | - | Application specific content identifier
parameters | `[]` | URL encoded list of parameters to be passed to the application being launched (usually directly to the app executable). The technique to pass parameters may be app specific. Please work with [app partners in DAB Registry](#7-appendix) for how the parameters are expected to be passed.

#### Sample Request

```json
{
   "appId": "YouTube",
   "contentId": "XqZsoesa55w"
}
```

#### Response Format

```typescript
type LaunchApplicationWithContentResponse = DabResponse
```

### Operation: Get the application state
*Operation model: Request / Response*

This operation returns the state the application is in.

#### Request Topic

`dab/<device-id>/applications/get-state`

#### Request Format

```typescript
interface GetApplicationStateRequest extends DabRequest {
   appId: string;
}
```

#### Request Parameters

Parameter | Default|  Description
--- | --- | ---
appId | - | Application Identifier

#### Sample Request

```json
{
   "appId": "YouTube"
}
```

#### Response Format

```typescript
interface GetApplicationStateResponse extends DabResponse {
   state: string;
}
```
#### Response Parameters

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
state | state of the application at the time of the request, one of `STOPPED`, `BACKGROUND` or `FOREGROUND`

#### Sample Response
```json
{
   "status": 200,
   "state": "BACKGROUND"
}
```

### Operation: Exiting the application
*Operation model: Request / Response*

This operation exits the application. 
* If the optional *background* parameter is set, this operation attempts to move the application to the BACKGROUND state.
* If the *background* parameter is omitted or is set to false, this operation attempts to completely stop the application and move it to a STOPPED state.

When using the exit operation without the background flag, the intention is to stop/kill the corresponding application process.
When using the exit operation with the background flag, the intention is to put the application in a background state, similarly to when the user presses  the `home` key.
The response should only be sent after the application state has changed on the platform.

#### Request Topic

`dab/<device-id>/applications/exit`

#### Request Format

```typescript
interface ExitApplicationRequest extends DabRequest {
   appId: string;
   background?: boolean;
}
```

#### Request Parameters

Parameter | Default|  Description
--- | --- | ---
appId | - | Application Identifier
background | false | decides whether to background or completely stop the application

#### Sample Request

```json
{
   "appId": "PrimeVideo",
   "background": false
}
```

#### Response Format

```typescript
interface ExitApplicationResponse extends DabResponse {
   state: string;
}
```
#### Response Parameters

Parameter |  Description
--- | --- 
state | state of the application after the exit operation


#### Sample Response
